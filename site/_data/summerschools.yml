While the summer school series flourished (47 events on 5 continents), the last event on Australian soil is more than 10 years ago. We are bringing MLSS back to Australia, specifically to Melbourne in early 2026. We are inviting 50 exceptional PhD students and early-career researchers to learn from 15 world-class speakers in seminars, tutorials and talks. The topics range from foundational ML theory to state-of-the-art methods to novel ideas and approaches. MLSS will be hosted in a beautiful venue in Port Melbourne in the middle of Australian summer. Applications are open until August 31 - apply now on our website."
